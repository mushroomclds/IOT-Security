# IOT-Security
This project for my IOT Security class uses mqtt and a broker to communicate data between a rpi and esp8266 feather. The big picture here is restroom/bathroom occupation and efficiency. It can be difficult to know if a restroom is occupied in public spaces and in residential homes and every second counts when you need one. This project will let people know of available stalls/restrooms through a LED and detects occupancy through an ultrasonic sensor. These sensors will be on the ESP8266 and send data through mqtt to RPI to play a relaxing song for comfortability and a mind reset. However after a while the music will go off to promote efficiency, whether at home or workspaces.
